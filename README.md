# Material_Science-and-Optical-property-Optimization
Recent development in Material informatics such as Material genomics development has opened ways to develop computational methods
to screen millions of materials with optimized properties for a sepcific purpose. For example, one can identify or select materials
with optimized electric and magnetic properties for varius applications with the help of artificial intelligence models.
