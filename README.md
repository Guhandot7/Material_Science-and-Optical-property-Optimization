# Material_Science-and-Optical-property-Optimization
Recent development in Material informatics such as Material genomics development has opened ways to develop computational methods
to screen millions of materials with optimized properties for a sepcific purpose. For example, one can identify or select materials
with optimized electric and magnetic properties for varius applications with the help of artificial intelligence models.

#Follwing are my objectives

1. Collect organic and inorganic molecules that absorb electromagnetic radiation and emit fluorescence

2. Develop machine learning predictive models for indentifying fluourescent materials from others and predict their optical properties

3. Use strucutural properties of materials as features for developing predictive models to select material combinations with desired electric and magnetic propertie
